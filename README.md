# ExampleProjects

Contains some of my previous projects.

Much of these are older and often from before I knew how to use git 
so I apologize for the lack of a version history. Newer projects will
include that as I begin them.

Not all of them represent my current level of knowledge and many are missing principles
and practice that I know about now.

Some of these are even from before taking university level computer science courses
and are more representative of my high-school level of knowledge.

I'm sorting through my old high school google drive download too to see if there's anything of value there.
